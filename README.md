# planets

### Install the project
First you need Node

- Clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/andreslopezlu/planets.git`
- Move into repo's folder
- Instal dependencies `npm install`
- For develop or run locally I suggest you to use live-server global `npm install live-server -g`

To start css and html environment, run `npm run start-dev`
Running the server, each time you modify js files, you need to compress them with `npm build-js``

Enjoy!
